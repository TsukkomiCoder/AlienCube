		<p3>I really gotta update this blog more often, lol.<br />The hype for Murder Drones episode 6 is quite yes. I still think Episode 4 was the best, it managed to keep me hyped for the longest (it also has my favourite scene in the series). Maybe the wholesome scenes were just so powerful they kept the hype going for so long.<br />Also, I am very much getting into Pikmin and its lore.</p3>
