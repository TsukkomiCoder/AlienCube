		<p3>Oh my, it's been quite a while since I posted in this little archive of mine. I guess I should leave my thoughts on Murder Drones episode 8 while I'm here!!<br />That episode was <b>INSANE</b>. I love this series so much, I had no idea I'd ever become to attached to the silly fictional robots when this series first started airing, but I am so glad I did end up becoming attaches to them. <br/>Also, a bunch of my friends call me "irl Uzi" now, and I can see why they do...</p3>
		<p3>And!!!! Some other exciting news is that the GRAND FESTIVAL happened in Splatoon 3!! <br />The theme was: Which is most important to you? The teams were Past, Present, and Future. I chose team Past because I'm 100% loyal to the Squid sist- I mean the past can help guide us towards our futures!! :D I'm so happy my team won that fest!!</p3>
		<p3><br />Anyways, I should get started on that art portfolio soon now, shouldn't I? Here's the link for it if you happen to be viewing this after I finally made it:<br ></p3>
		<a href="art_portfo.html">Art Portfolio</a>
		<p3><br />I'll do that after I finish the website for the totally not fan fiction that I told my bestie to write!!!! Okay that's the end of this archive post BYEEEEEE</p3>
